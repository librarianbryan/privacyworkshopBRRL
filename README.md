# Privacy Workshop Slides

These are slides for online privacy workshops offered to library patrons and other librarians. These are typically updated annually.

They slides are created in [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

They are inspired by Amber Adams' [privacy talk](https://github.com/amberadams/privacy-talk) and Library Freedom Project's [Online Privacy Basics](https://libraryfreedomproject.org/resources-01/onlineprivacybasics/) class.
